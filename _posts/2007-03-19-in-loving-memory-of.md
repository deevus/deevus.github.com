This is a song I wrote just before I moved to Sydney. Its only a demo recording, but I thought I would upload it anyway :)

It was recorded live in my lounge room using two SM57s. I only have one boom mic stand, so I had one mic on a stand at my mouth with a pop filter in front of it. The other microphone, funnily enough, was sitting in an empty tissue box, about a foot from the guitar, aimed at where the neck meets the body.

The song itself is about two people I've known in my life that have died suddenly. They were both unexpected deaths, and both very young. I didn't know them very well, but I did feel overwhelming sadness on both occasions.
