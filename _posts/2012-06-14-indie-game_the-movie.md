<p>Every once and a while you see a film or documentary that inspires you to go do something. Most likely a time-sink that will have a great negative impact on your social life.</p>

<p><strong>My Last Inspiration Driven Time-Sink</strong></p>

<p>10 years ago it was Red Hot Chili Peppers' documentary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-Funky/dp/6305750467">Funky Monks</a> that made me really want to learn to play guitar. I wanted to live and breathe John Frusciante. That was a man crush, to be sure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After two years of painstaking work, designer Edmund McMillen and programmer Tommy Refenes await the release of their first major game for Xbox, Super Meat Boyâ€”the adventures of a skinless boy in search of his girlfriend, who is made of bandages. At PAX, a major video-game expo, developer Phil Fish unveils his highly anticipated, four-years-in-the-making FEZ. Jonathan Blow considers beginning a new game after creating Braid, one of the highest-rated games of all time.</p>

<p>To start, I was impressed that my girlfriend sat through the whole thing with me. At the end I was quite interested in what her take was, since she is neither a gamer or a "computer person".</p>

  <p>I don't want you to make a game - Simon's girlfriend</p>

<p>I really enjoyed it, but the amount of time one would spend to make a game would have a rippling effects on your life, which was obviously picked up on by her.</p>

<p>You could say that IGTM was a nerve-wracking film in many respects. Several horrors of independent game development were highlighted.</p>

<ol>
<li>Edmund and Tommy struggled with meeting Microsoft's deadline to publish <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat Boy</a> on <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/XboxArcadeGames">XBLA</a>, pushing themselves to the brink of mental and physical breakdown</li>
<li>Jonathon felt the weight of the critical success of <a href="http://braid-game.com/">Braid</a>, where his game was widely misunderstood, the majority of players missing its inherent personal nature. </li>
<li>Phil was haunted by the fallout between himself and a previous silent partner, leaving his game <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/61-2">Fez</a>' presence at PAX hanging in the balance.</li>
</ol>

<p>I couldn't help but get emotionally involved when watching, and given my recent plans to make my own game, rather excited to make something happen for myself.</p>

<p>I don't want to give away too much. If you are a budding game developer, designer or indie game enthusiast I think you will really enjoy Indie Game: The Movie.</p>
