I have just discovered <a href="http://friggeri.net/blog/2007/07/13/vimpress">Vimpress</a> which is a plugin for <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>, a great text editor which I have been using/learning for the last few months. The plugin requires <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/">Python 2.4</a> to be installed to work and here are some <a href="http://phorolinux.com/vimpress-publish-wordpress-blog-posts-from-vim.html">plugin install instructions</a> to get you going.

Once setup your next post is only a :BlogSend away!

On a vim related note, I have recently been reading <a href="http://vim.runpaint.org/">Vim Recipes</a>, a "free cookbook for the vim text editor". I have already learnt a few new things which is always welcome to make my vim experience that much better.
