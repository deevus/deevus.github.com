<p>It is a really weird feeling when you hear a band playing a song you were playing 7 years ago. I felt a mix between nostalgia, contempt, anger, jealously and then understanding.</p>

<p>In 2005, I was playing in a band in Newcastle. I can't even remember how I got started with them, but they were all friends and I was the outsider.</p>

<p>For some reason, we were never ready to gig, so we just rehearsed several times a week, until something happened between the lead singer and the bass player (who were seeing each other at the time). It was all a bit too complicated so we parted ways. It also might have been that I was a horrible guitarist and they wanted to let me down gently, but that's just my <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx">phony-syndrome</a> flaring up.</p>

<p>Moving to 2012, I get linked to a <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> page for a new band by a previous member of the old band. Inside, a single video of a song that sounded very familiar. So familiar that I still had recordings of rehearsals when we used to play it.</p>

<p><sup>Just a disclaimer: I'm not implying that the song is mine, or that I've been ripped off by them in any way. They haven't used any of my intellectual property as far as I can tell. The songs were not mine, I just wrote lead guitar for them.</sup></p>

<p>All in all I think I'm just a bit jealous that they are still out there having fun playing music and I'm not. I made my choice to be a programmer and music fell by the wayside. That's not to say that I didn't give music a good go, because I was in several bands over the years, including one that I started myself a few years ago, where the band was playing MY music.</p>

<p>It is still a dream of mine to make a semi-professional home recording studio, and jam out tunes until I'm 80, but I love what I'm doing now. I keep looking at the acoustic guitar in the corner thinking I should write some new songs.</p>

<p>Given some time I think I will.</p>
