I had a dream a while ago that I was friends with a person I've known for years. Unfortunately we've never really got along for some reason or another.  So it has inspired a song.

Recorded using a desktop mic in one take, as usual. There is a terrible cut and paste at the end, which comes through as a volume swell. I was using Audacity and I couldn't find the right tools to get it how I wanted.

<span style="font-style: italic;">Verse</span>

We were somewhere familiar
It was like you lived next door
Couldn't help but just sit and chat
In this dream I had

We were getting along so well
Hows it going? Im doing swell
The reality's much farther
From this dream but I could not tell

<span style="font-style: italic;">Chorus</span>

If only it stayed this way
It will be all over
I hope that one day
Maybe it will be like this

<span style="font-style: italic;">Verse 2</span>

We were sitting on the grass
Picking shapes out of the clouds
Just because it was not real
Does not mean I didn't feel it

<span style="font-style: italic;">Chorus 2</span>

If only it stayed this way
It will be all over
I hope that one day
Maybe it will be like this

Can you see me
I wanna try to make it real
Just like that night
That I dreamt we were friends

<span style="font-style: italic;">Coda</span>

I dreamt that we were friends
How could you be so cold
Ice in my bed
Daemons in my head

I dreamt that we were friends
I cant see the reason
That we failed
