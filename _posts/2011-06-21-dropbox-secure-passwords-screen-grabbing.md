<h1>The Cloud</h1>
Use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTMwMTY0NDM5?src=referrals_fb_post9">Dropbox</a>? You should! There's not an easier way to store your files in the cloud. Sure, Dropbox has had some <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/06/dropbox-accidentally-unlocked-all-accounts-for-4-hours/">bumps along the way</a> but you shouldn't really have your credit card or banking details in there anyway. If there is something in there that requires utmost care, since it is <strong>just a directory on your computer, </strong>it can store any type of file, like a <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> partition...
<h2>Password Security</h2>
I don't need anything like that right now, but I do store all my passwords in Dropbox using <a href="http://agilebits.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>.

Imagine never having to remember more than 1 Password, and <strong>all </strong>of your logins are secure! Even if someone got the password to your favourite gaming forum, they wouldn't be able to get into anything else (like your online banking). 1Password is not free, but the user interface is great, it integrates with almost every browser you'd ever want to use and it runs on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. <a href="http://help.agilebits.com/1Password_Windows/index.html#automatically_keep_your_data_in_sync_on_pcs_macs_and_ios_devices">Store it right in Dropbox</a> and you've got your passwords on all your everyday devices (home, work, tablet or phone).

If you are looking for a free alternative you can always try <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>, but do try out 1Password as it comes with a 30 day trial.
<h2>Sharing is Caring</h2>
If you've ever wanted to share a screengrab with a buddy or co-worker you probably had to go through some grueling manual process:
<ol>
	<li>Press PrintScn (or Alt + PrintScn) to take the shot</li>
	<li>Paste into your <a href="http://www.paint.net/">image editor of choice</a></li>
	<li>Save to a suitable format</li>
	<li>Upload to <a href="http://imgur.com/">some</a> <a href="http://imageshack.us/">image</a> <a href="http://photobucket.com/">host</a></li>
	<li>Find the direct link</li>
	<li>Send to your buddy/co-worker</li>
</ol>
I don't know about you but I wanted a better way!

Well, <a href="http://wiki.dropbox.com/DropboxAddons/DropboxScreenGrabber">Dropbox Screen Grabber</a> is the answer. I'm not sure who Tomaž Muraus is (either a Dropbox developer or community member), but this thing is cool! It doesn't have an installer, just a binary zip with the required files to run. When running, it just sits in your tray unobtrusively, and all you need to do is use the hotkey you set to get it to work.  <img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3016443/screengrab_20110621213416.jpg" alt="" />

As you can see from the image above, you can set two hotkeys:
<ul>
	<li>A full screen screenshot</li>
	<li>A screenshot of the active window</li>
</ul>
I will probably stray away from the default hotkeys as some programs I use utilise those keys but for now the defaults should suffice. Below is an image of the notification you receive when the grab is successful. There's also an option to copy the link straight to your clipboard, just right click the tray icon to access all the options.

It has a few things I would improve (such as fullscreen application support such as games) but it serves well as a handy work tool removing one of the manual processes we could do without. One thing to check if you are having issues is that the Public folder does exist in your Dropbox. If it doesn't the program will not work, and it will give you no indication that there's a problem (apart from the lack of notification).

Happy grabbing! (that's not creepy at all)
