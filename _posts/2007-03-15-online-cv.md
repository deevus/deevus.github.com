I have been a music enthusiast since a young age. At the age of 5, I remember listening to <span style="font-style: italic;">Under The Bridge</span> by <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Red Hot Chili Peppers</span> almost every night with my elder brother, and falling in love with it. My brother was a major influence in the music I listened to, and he introduced me to my still favourite artist <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radiohead</span> around the time of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bends</span>.

When a close childhood friend started playing the guitar, he would come over often to record things he'd come up with on <span style="font-style: italic;">Cool Edit</span>. It was then, that I knew I had a desire to work in music, and I decided to take up the guitar, at 17 years.

I studied both music business and technology at <span style="font-weight: bold;">TAFE</span> in Newcastle, NSW, Australia and learned a lot of things about how the music industry works.

My major goal is to become the House Engineer for a reputable studio and record and mix music, helping bands get their music out there.
