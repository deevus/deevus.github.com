This is another song I wrote before I moved to Sydney. I'm not sure if its complete, but I really like it.

I recorded it really late one evening using my computer desktop mic. It doesn't sound too bad, considering!

I know a lot of people who tend to overload themselves with work, emotions, homework, whatever! I do it too, and that's what its about.
