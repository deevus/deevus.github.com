So I've now migrated from my crappy Blogger account to Wordpress. Goodbye crappy 800x600 themes and lackluster customisation options! I am so impressed in how easy Wordpress was to setup and to use:
<ol>
	<li>FTP to server</li>
	<li>Point to database</li>
	<li>Run installation</li>
</ol>
Another biggy is that I have a shiny new domain name. What better way to represent myself than a domain name which is...my name? I was surprised when I found out how cheap it was as well.

Last but not least, I would like to thank <a href="http://dancenode.com" target="_blank">Dancenode</a> for the hosting. Thanks guys!
