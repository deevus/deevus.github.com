<strong>Lyrics</strong>

It wont be forever
It wont be too long either
This time
My time

With passion waiting dormant
Slowly comes to life
My soul
My fight

I wont fade this time
You cant play my mind

I'm feeling strong already
I'll take on your pride
Your guile
You hide

I wont fade this time
You cant play my mind
