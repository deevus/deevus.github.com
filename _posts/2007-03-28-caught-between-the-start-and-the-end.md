I couldn't sleep and all I could think of was the title. So I decided to expand, and write a song. Just a demo recorded live using the desktop mic, with some harmonies overdubbed.

I'm caught between the start and end of something
I can't believe this situations happening
As I can see the ends have started fraying
And I am
And I am again..
I'm caught between the start and the end

I don't really know how I got in
It seems there's this rut that I'm stuck in
You keep telling me to get out there
But I am
But I am again..
I'm caught between the start and the end
