You avoid obstacles by rotating around a cable in order to gain as much speed as possible. There is no up or down; there is only the cable to which you are attached.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://www.proun-game.com/">Proun</a> is a mix between a racing game and abstract art, pitting you against bots, ghosts of yourself (your previous bests) and countless players online. I found the art style quite pleasing and it really compliments the game mechanics. Having all these different shapes and colours trying to foil your racing line is both aesthetically pleasing and mechanically challenging. There are also <a href="http://www.proun-game.com/UserTracks.html">user-made tracks</a> which will no doubt increase the longevity of the game once there are more to choose from.</p>  <h3>How Much Does It Cost?</h3>  <p>The most interesting thing is that Proun employs the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want">pay-what-you-want</a> model that more indie games seem to be embracing. My first foray into this was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/arts/music/09pare.html?ex=1354856400&amp;en=ec2f1c29937292be&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">Radiohead’s In Rainbows</a>, which despite being a happy accident for the band, is now an ever getting more popular for indie games developers such as Frozenbyte with their now finished but successful <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a>. </p>  <p>Personally, I paid $10USD for the game, but as the model implies, you can pay whatever you want. This includes <strong>nothing.</strong> There are benefits to paying, as all paying customers receive a bonus map. For me, $10 seems to be the sweet spot for these kind of games. They don’t take forever to make but they are filled with love, and if everyone who played gave them 10 bucks, I’m sure their next game will have just as much love. They might even make enough to feed their kids. </p>  <h3>The Future…</h3>  <p>It is really sad that a lot of these gems are missed by the majority of gamers just because they aren’t AAA. There are nostalgic games for the 20-30’s age bracket like the bullet-hell game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/94200/">Jamestown</a>, which is totally new to the teens of today who missed out on the games of old.</p>  <p>I am a big supporter of indie games and I buy just about all of them that come on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>. Valve are great supporters of indie games and I would love to see Proun on there. Maybe one day Valve might even implement a pay-what-you-want system of their own, where the greater gaming community will see more of these kind of games in a pricing model that really works for them. </p>
