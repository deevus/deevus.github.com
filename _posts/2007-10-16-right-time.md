Where I am cold and lonesome
Where are you?
I hope you're okay
Stop there
Stay where you are
Don't be fooled
You don't know where you're heading to

Looking for the right time
To commit the right crime
You better watch yourself
Coz sometimes you'll open an old wound

My head hurts
I've got needles in my brain
Please stop this torture
Well I guess that you were right
I guess I was wrong

Looking for the right time
To commit the right crime
You better watch yourself
Coz sometimes you'll open an old wound
