<p>I had been thinking of getting a tablet for a while, dating back to when the iPad first came out, and when iOS was cutting edge. In my opinion that is no longer the case, and although the iPad2 is on top in terms of sales, the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer is hot on its heels.</p>

<p>I had been following the Samsung Galaxy Tab as the top contender for purchase when I was referred to the Transformer by my brother when they were due for release in Australia on June ??.</p>

<p>I took the plunge and picked one up from a local Harvey Norman for $900 with 3 years warranty. The price might sound high but for what you get it is very good value. I got the 32gb version which comes with the keyboard dock (shown below) for free. There is a 16gb version but it does not come with the dock.</p>

<p>Basically, what you get is a tablet and a netbook in one. This is great. Seriously. Get one now.</p>

<p>When I'm lounging around the house or in bed I can use it as a tablet; Watch youtube, go through RSS feeds, reply to emails, browse the web or watch a movie. When docked you gain the extra convenience of a netbook; Typing documents, post to my blog (I'm writing this on it right now),</p>
