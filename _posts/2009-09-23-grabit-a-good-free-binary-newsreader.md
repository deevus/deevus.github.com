I recently started using Usenet through <a href="http://astraweb.com">Astraweb</a> which has been great. Its a great way to get filesâ€¦FAST! The problem was I couldnâ€™t find a decent client that was free, supported binary downloads and had auto repair (PAR support).

I had been using a trial of <a href="http://www.newsbin.com/">Newsbin Pro</a> which was great but I thought there surely must be a free alternative out there. After a bit of searching I found <a href="http://shemes.com/">GrabIt</a> â€“ A free binary newsreader with all the features I mentioned above. Simply <a href="http://download.shemes.com/GrabIt172b4.exe">download</a> and install! No bloatware to be found. The only advertising is a menu item (<em>shown below) </em>which opens browser links to <a href="http://shemes.com">Shemes.com</a> Usenet Services.

<img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="GrabIt" src="http://www.simonhartcher.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image.png" border="0" alt="GrabIt" width="644" height="468" />

They provide Usenet Search subscriptions which I guess seem like pretty good value but I find <a href="http://newzleech.com/">Newzleech</a> to be more than sufficient. There are also Sheme Usenet Server subscriptions but Astraweb is much better value.

The only tinkering I needed to do after installation was increase the number of server connections.<a href="http://www.simonhartcher.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" src="http://www.simonhartcher.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/image_thumb.png" border="0" alt="image" width="162" height="244" align="right" /></a>
<ol>
	<li> Right-Click <em>Default Server</em> under <em>Subscribed groups</em></li>
	<li>Click <em>server properties</em></li>
	<li>Move the slider bar under <em>Maximum allowed connections </em>to the right to increase the value (up to a maximum of 32 connections)</li>
	<li>Click <em>Ok</em></li>
</ol>
Any downloaded files will automatically extract (and repair if needed) to a directory which you can specify in <em>Preferences</em> under <em>Edit</em>. GrabIt comes with nzb support and association, so the steps to downloading a file is simple:
<ol>
	<li> Start a Usenet search at <a href="http://newzleech.com">Newzleech</a></li>
	<li>Download and open the nzb file for the desired file(s)</li>
</ol>
Have fun!
