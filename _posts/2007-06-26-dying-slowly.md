When you're by yourself
Its like theres no one else
Cars go screaming by
No one at the wheel

Justice in your mind
If you think hard you'll find
Things will disappear
Like they're just not here

Paper lines the streets
Clogging up the drains
What the headlines said
The world is truly dead

You killed it in one blow
Polluted it like snow
On a living hill
The grass will slowly die

Stop to look and see
The world is dying slowly
Where will we all be
When we're all alone
