I really love <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>. For me it is to the Naughties (2000's)Â as The NewsÂ was to the Nineties (1990's). I love reading my news items in the morning, and they're all items I actually <em>want</em> to read.

There's a couple of ways that you can use Google Reader other than the regular site. Google have provided a 'goodie' bookmarklet which brings upÂ each unread item sequentially but within the context of the item. That is, it takes you to the actual item on the parent site. Recently, Google have released a brand new <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/05/brand-new-google-reader-for-iphone.html" target="_blank">Google Reader for iPhone</a>. Their intention was to give a better experience on mobile browsers, but since its just a webpage, you can access it from any browser (at least for the moment).

To get Google Reader in your Firefox sidebar, simply do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Open BookmarksÂ -&gt;Â Organise Bookmarks (Ctrl+Shift+B)</li>
	<li>Right Click "Bookmarks Toolbar" -&gt; New Bookmark (You don't have to put it in your toolbar but it seemed the logical choice for me)</li>
	<li>Create a bookmark with the address - <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/i/">http://www.google.com/reader/i/</a></li>
	<li>
<div class="mceTemp">Tick "Load this bookmark in the sidebar"</div></li>
</ol>

And you're done. Its as simple as clicking the bookmark which will open Google Reader in your sidebar.
