On a forum that I frequent there is a thread "What are you listening to now?" where people simply post the name of the song they're listening to. While I was bored I created a <span style="font-weight: bold;">current-song</span> command which grabs the name of the song you're listening to from the <a href="http://www.foxytunes.com/">FoxyTunes</a> addon and pastes it into the currently focused editable text area.
