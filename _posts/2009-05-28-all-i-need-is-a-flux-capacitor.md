Today I found a letter which had been placed on the windscreen of my car under a wiper blade. According to the letter there is going to be some work in my street to complete some work they did a few months back. Everything seemed nominal except the date in which they are going to do the work:

They must be a bit behind schedule... and that's not surprising. The hard part about it is that I am required to move my car from the work area to make their job easier, which is fine. But when are they <em>actually doing the work?</em> Obviously, the date is wrong. They must have scheduled the work for the previous date and in true government fashion have had to delay and reschedule.

So, I called the number they provided, and after a bout of confusion as to why the letter stated the wrong date, it was confirmed that the work is happening <em>tonight</em>. It also turns out that the work is not going to be as far as my apartment, so I shouldn't be affected.

No harm done in the end, but people really should proof read letters before they send them out...
