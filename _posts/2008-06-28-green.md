Its not what I wanted
To be in this room
Full of preachers
Who don't want to know

Where are the animate?
Their justice is good.

Stare at the hourglass
Frozen and bored
Yield to hegemony
My eyes to the floor

Dead on the tracks
Aimless, bitterness
Green.
Wonderless, emptiness.

Yield to hegemony
Their justice is torn
Facing your enemy
Stuck on the shore

Dead on the tracks
Aimless, bitterness
Green.
Wonderless, emptiness.
