<p>Stack Overflow DevDays is back in 2011 and <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/sydney/">they’re coming to Sydney</a>! Joel Spolsky announced this today on <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/06/27.html">his</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/devdays-is-back/">Stack Overflow’s blog</a>, and Joel himself is in the <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/sydney/#agenda">agenda for the Sydney event</a>. Whether this means that he will be there in person is yet to be seen. I am imagining a recorded welcome message of some sort, but I hope he will be there.</p>  <p><a href="http://simonhartcher.com/wp-content/uploads/StackOverflow-Devdays-2011Sydney_8BD8/20110629sydneydevdaysagenda.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="20110629sydneydevdaysagenda" border="0" alt="20110629sydneydevdaysagenda" src="http://simonhartcher.com/wp-content/uploads/StackOverflow-Devdays-2011Sydney_8BD8/20110629sydneydevdaysagenda_thumb.png" width="553" height="370" /></a></p>  <p>When the 2009 DevDays was announced I was pretty excited but unfortunately there was no Sydney event, so I am super pumped that they are coming to Australia this time round. Work might even be covering the cost for me.</p>  <p>What’s being covered and the full lineup of speakers isn’t fully decided yet but here’s what the event page currently says:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Stack Overflow DevDays this 25-26 October in Sydney.&#160; This 2-day conference will feature technical programming talks and networking with your fellow Stack Overflow users. </p>    <p>The <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-developer-days-conference/">2009 Stack Overflow DevDays</a> received rave reviews, featuring all the latest programming topics like Python, Android, jQuery, iPhone, FogBugz, QT and ASP.net MVC.&#160;&#160; The speakers at 2009′s Stack Overflow DevDays included Joel Spolsky, Jeff Atwood, Scott Hanselman, James Yum, Mark Harrison, Daniel Rocha, Yehuda Katz, Cody Lindley, Dan Sanderson, Steve Seitz, Ted Leung, Dan Pilone, Ned Batchelder, Patrick Hynds, Chris Bowen, John Resig, Miguel De Icaza, Eric Jones, Travis Oliphant, Jonathan Johnson, Peter Mourfield, Jonathan Sharm, Damien Katz and Jason Cohen.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I can’t wait!</p>
