Just a demo that had more effort involved than usual. Some off notes and timing issues.

<strong>Lyrics</strong>

Where do we go from here
The road ahead is clear
It seems like so long
Since we've been home

We've got to be strong
If we make it through
All I know right now
You must leave everything behind

After all is finished
We'll be hard as stone
Jump in and take on the world
They won't know what hit 'em

We've got to be strong
If we make it through
All I know right now
You must leave everything behind

Its getting darker now
The sun makes a silhouette
Buildings all in black
Time to settle down
